# Weather API service

The weather API is build using `Python` and `FastAPI`

## Reasoning for fast API

- Fast to run and has similar performance to NodeJS and Go
- Designed to be non-complex and easy to pick up
- Great support

## Setting up venv

- Create venv `python3 -m venv weather-app`
- Enter venv `source tutorial-env/bin/activate`
- Install requirements defined in `./requirements.txt` with `pip3 -r ./requirements.txt` for the application and ensure you install `pytest`

## Running the API

- Install requirements defined in `./requirements.txt`

## Running the tests

- From the api directory run the following `python -m pytest tests/`
